# Insights into Online Shopper Behavior

## Overview

This project analyzes a bank marketing dataset to forecast the performance of marketing initiatives using machine learning classification algorithms. The goal is to predict whether a marketing effort will be successful or unsuccessful based on various attributes such as day of the week, region, and browser. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset), which includes features like:

- Administrative
- Administrative_Duration
- Informational
- Informational_Duration
- ProductRelated
- ProductRelated_Duration
- BounceRates
- ExitRates
- PageValues
- SpecialDay
- Month
- OperatingSystems
- Browser
- Region
- TrafficType
- VisitorType
- Weekend
- Revenue (Target Variable)

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Examined feature distributions and correlations.
   - Visualized patterns in the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Conducted feature engineering and converted categorical data into numerical format.
   - Cleaned the dataset by removing outliers, missing values, and duplicates.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - **Algorithms Used:**
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting Classification
   - **Metrics:**
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
     - ROC Curve
     - Precision-Recall Curve

4. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Identified key features influencing model predictions, such as PageValues, ExitRates, and ProductRelated_Duration.

## Results

- **Random Forest:**
  - Accuracy: 91%
  - Precision: 93%
  - Recall: 96%
  - F1-score: 92%
  - AUC (ROC): 0.98
  - AUC (Precision-Recall): 0.95

- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Accuracy: 88%
  - Precision: 73%
  - Recall: 32%
  - F1-score: 44%
  - AUC (ROC): 0.83
  - AUC (Precision-Recall): 0.61

- **Gradient Boosting Classification:**
  - Accuracy: 89%
  - Precision: 68%
  - Recall: 60%
  - F1-score: 64%
  - AUC (ROC): 0.77
  - AUC (Precision-Recall): 0.73

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy and overall performance, indicating its robustness in predicting marketing success. Insights into feature importance suggest that PageValues plays a significant role in revenue generation.
